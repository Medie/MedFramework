# UiPath Modular Framework: GetData and ProcessData Workflows

This framework separates data retrieval (GetData) and data processing (ProcessData) into distinct workflows. This modular approach ensures scalability, better error handling, and easier maintenance.

## Framework Description

The framework is designed to handle data retrieval and processing efficiently, making them scalable and easy to manage independently.

### 1. GetData Workflow

**Purpose**: To fetch data from various sources such as databases, APIs, files, or Orchestrator queues.

**Steps**:

1. Initialize the environment and set up any required configurations.
2. Connect to the data source.
3. Retrieve the required data.
4. Store the retrieved data in a suitable storage medium (e.g., Orchestrator queue, database, or files).
5. Log the status and handle any errors.

### 2. ProcessData Workflow

**Purpose**: To process the data retrieved by the `GetData` workflow.

**Steps**:

1. Initialize the environment and set up any required configurations.
2. Fetch the data from the storage medium (e.g., read from the queue or database).
3. Process each item individually or in batches.
4. Handle business logic and apply necessary transformations.
5. Log the status and handle any errors.
6. Update the status of processed items (e.g., marking queue items as successful or failed).

## Benefits of This Framework

- **Modularity**: Easily maintain and update the `GetData` and `ProcessData` workflows independently.
- **Scalability**: Scale each part separately to handle more data or processing power.
- **Error Handling**: Better error management as each workflow can handle errors specific to its operations.

This framework ensures that data retrieval and processing are handled efficiently and can be scaled or modified independently without affecting the entire system.

### Customization

If you've got specific data sources or processing needs, tweak this framework to better suit your requirements.
